# Solar-cycle-prediction
In this study, I have presented Random Forest, XGBoost, Light GBM, Histogram Gradient Boosting, Ridge regression models using python to forecast the 25 and 26th solar cycle using the monthly sunspot area (SSA) data from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich (RGO) USAF/NOAA during the period of May 1874 to April 2023(149 years).
